# Library_wxWidgets

A little project with wxWidgets and SQLite3.
Right now the project contains showing off a books of search and a possibility to rent them.
In futer posibly I will add a user account to hand over the books and have the rent historIy.



I was using CMake to run this whole project. In my CMake I provide only way thay you have to installed the library on your own.



wxWidgets: https://www.wxwidgets.org/



SQLite3: https://www.sqlite.org/index.html



This is the way how do to that.



CMake:

    1) mkdir build && cd build
    2) cmake ..
    3) make
    4) ./p
